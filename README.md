Repo for Eucalypt analysis of Australia using records from Atlas of Living Australia
(https://doi.org/10.26197/ala.3bf1b394-8646-4e3e-99d9-0ef7a5258d35). 

Repo starts with:
Dataprep_jack_1st.rmd , where the data is cleaned from the Atlas of Living Australia records so data is at a high quality for analysis.

The cleaned data is then imported in to Biodiverse analysis software (http://www.biodiverse.unsw.edu.au), with analyses for phylogenetic endemism and phylogenetic diversity conducted in the software.

The results from Biodiverse are then imported back into R and analysed further with Post_biodiverse_analysis.rmd for results and graphs.
